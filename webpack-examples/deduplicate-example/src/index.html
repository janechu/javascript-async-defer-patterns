        <p>
            This example demonstrates a script that waits for the page to load until it is complete. It shows both a lazy and eager loading of two pieces of functionality which results in two <code>js</code> files being generated, and how both of these pieces of functionality rely on <code>lodash</code> and how that can be deduplicated.
        </p>
        <div id="reachable">
            This element should be reachable by both scripts.
