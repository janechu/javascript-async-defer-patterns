# JavaScript loading patterns

This project seeks to demonstrate the different methods by which scripts may be loaded onto a web site/application and where this may be beneficial to getting critical functionality to the user sooner and deferring non-critical functionality.

The `examples/` folder contains the available examples and the `webpack-examples/` folder will show the implementation of that example using `webpack` using the same name.

These examples seek to inform how loading patterns are best optimized.
